00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.874
[visible confusion]

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.685
[horse's happy neigh]

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:16.435
Everyone tells me not to get old

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:25.485
I'm more worried about stonks and money

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:33.939
I'm so attached to my cell phone

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:41.555
But when they all leave, what does it all mean?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.625
Oh! those lonely people where do you all call home?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.758
Baby, I've been feelin’ nothing lately

00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:59.844
Won't you find the time to save me

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:06.644
It's gettin’ late, i wanna go where you go

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:14.913
Everyone tells me not to get married

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:23.066
I'm more worried about dead old fashioned-love

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:31.042
Oh! those lonely people where do you all call home?

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:37.063
Baby, I've been feelin’ nothing lately

00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:41.148
Won't you find the time to save me

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.819
It's gettin’ late, i wanna go where you go

00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:53.512
Baby, ain't no drink that satisfies me

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.754
All these pills just make me hungry

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:04.241
Is it cool? i never wanted you to go

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:08.566
Straight through the heart with no form of answer

00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:12.561
You were the one who shot me first

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.935
Anything i can do, he can do better!

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.395
Am i just for fun, am i just for fun?

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:24.887
[boogie time]

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.037
Baby, I've been feelin’ nothing lately

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.992
Won't you find the time to save me

00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:45.592
It's gettin’ late, i wanna go where you go

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:51.153
Baby, ain't no drink that satisfies me

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.811
All these pills just make me hungry

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.091
Is it cool? i never wanted you to go

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.231
